***READ ME***

This project is going to create a fully functional calculator. The calculator will add, subtract, divide, and multiply. The display will live update and it will string together long equations of numbers. Optionally I am going to try and program a backspace button, floating point number support, and keyboard support as well. 

I will be using CSS grid for the layout and basic Javascript with multiple event listeners/DOM manipulation for the functionality of the buttons.
